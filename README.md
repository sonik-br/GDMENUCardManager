# GDMENU Card Manager
Manage content on SD Card for Dreamcast's GDEmu/GDMenu

For GDEMU to properly work it's required to follow a pattern when putting files on the SD Card.<br/>
If not done correctly it will take a lot of time to boot and can even fail to.<br/>
This program will save the files the proper way so you console will boot super fast!

### GDI Shrinking
Can reduce the size of the game but some games won't work properly.

The program have a blacklist with some games known to have problems after shrinking.

By default the blacklist will be used and those games will not be shrunk.

### Windows version requires the .Net 6 Desktop Runtime
Download and install the [Desktop Runtime installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) for your system.
